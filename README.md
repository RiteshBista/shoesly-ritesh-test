```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

```

_\*Shoesly works on iOS and Android._

## Assumptions Made During Development ðŸ§ª

The majority of the data should be dynamic to simulate a real-world scenario, although some static data was used for testing purposes.
Asset paths for shoe and brand images are stored in Firebase.
User authentication and management are handled via Firebase Authentication.
Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them

## Populating Shoes and Reviews Data in Firestore

The requirement to populate shoes and reviews with meaningful names, prices, and reviews presented a challenge due to the volume of data needed.
Solution

Utilized ChatGPT to generate realistic dummy data for shoes and reviews, which was then stored in the database efficiently.
Implementing Real-Time Updates
Ensuring that the UI reflects real-time updates from Firestore without performance issues was crucial.
Solution

## Leveraged Firestoreâ€™s real-time capabilities and used efficient querying and indexing strategies to keep the app responsive.

Additional Features

## Dynamic Add to Cart Bottom Sheet: Implemented a bottom sheet that dynamically updates with the selected shoeâ€™s details.

PageView on Homepage and Description Page: Added a PageView widget to enhance navigation and user experience on the homepage and description pages.

## Animated Splash Screen: Created an engaging and animated splash screen to improve the first impression of the app.

## CI/CD added
